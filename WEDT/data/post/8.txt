Some more detail on the fate of Winamp and Shoutcast, the legacy digital music services that owner AOL (which also owns TechCrunch) originally planned to shut down but then halted pending a sale. They are not being bought by Microsoft , as we had heard when we first reported news of a sale. The properties are instead being acquired by Radionomy ? an international aggregator of online radio stations headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The Radionomy connection was first noticed by a couple of people, including one Bryon Stout on the Winamp forums and Carsten Knobloch , who saw that Winamp?s nameservers, but not Shoutcast?s, had been transferred to Radionomy. We have since learned from a reliable source that the deal is for both properties and should be finalised by Friday, if not sooner. Radionomy has some 6,000 stations in its catalog already, with an emphasis on a do-it-yourself platform that anyone can use to create a channel. Shoutcast?s 50,000-strong catalog of radio stations will be a major boost on that front. Winamp?s media playing software could be used to help program those radio stations and offer additional services. The acquisition may also see the two products and platforms put to work in more commercial settings. One of Radionomy?s strategic investors is MusicMatic , which develops audio and video experiences for stores and other venues.
