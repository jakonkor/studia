Let?s be real here: there?s a decent chance that you picked up a new smartphone at some point during the holidays, so you?re off the market for at least a little while longer. As it turns out though, you may have been better off waiting a bit. In a show of New Years magnanimity (or, you know, a ploy to push more units) Motorola has slashed the prices of its sans -contract Moto X ? a fully-customized 16GB model for any carrier will now only set you back $399 rather than the $499 it would?ve originally cost. Sadly, those of you with a woodgrain fetish will still have to pay a premium for those newly-available bamboo backs ? $100 to be precise. Does this ultimately mean you should pick up a Moto X over, say, a Nexus 5? Not necessarily ? much as I love what the new Motorola is up to these days the Nexus is still my pick for Android device of the year ? but it?s a little heartening to see a big name manufacturer is working to reduce the gap between on and off-contract device pricing for high-end smartphones. If anything, it?s that pricing precedent that seems most interesting here. Between this price cut and the introduction of the wallet-friendly Moto G back in late November, Motorola is positioning itself as a player that can deliver new remarkably solid (and in the X?s case, remarkably thoughtful) smartphone experiences at prices that can seem outlandishly low compared to most competitors.
