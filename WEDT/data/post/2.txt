GymPact, the app gives you money if you make your fitness goals, has a new name, Pact , and two new diet-oriented features for the New Year. We covered GymPact when it first launched a year ago and again in June when it received $850,000 in funding from the founder of Guitar Hero. It recently secured an additional $1.5 million in a seed round led by Khosla Ventures and Max Levchin to expand its features beyond exercise. Founder Yifang Zhang tells me that GymPact changed its name because ?only about one out of five people understood the ?impact? pun.? The ?gym? part of the name was also confusing for users because the app not only counts gym check-ins, but also check-ins at other fitness centers, outdoor runs, walks, bike rides and activity measured by the wearable tech devices and apps it integrates with, including RunKeeper, Jawbone UP, Fitbit, Moves, MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal. Now that the app?s latest version includes two new features focused on healthy eating. To use the app, you can chose to make a ?pact? to exercise, log your meals on MyFitnessPal.com or eat vegetables for a certain number of days. When you sign up for a pact, you select a certain amount?$5 or $10?that is deducted from your credit card or PayPal account for each day you miss. If you hit your goal, then you get paid a reward ranging from 30 cents to $5 per week as soon as you accumulate $10. That payout comes out of the pool of money from people who didn?t make their pact.
