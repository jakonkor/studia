Google?s VP9 video codec is getting a major boost today. While Mozilla , Google?s own Chrome browser and a few video players like FFmpeg started supporting VP9 over the course of the last year, what was mostly missing from Google?s ecosystem for this highly efficient video codec was hardware support. As Google announced today, however, virtually all major hardware vendors will soon support VP9 natively in their products and allow Google?s YouTube to stream HD content up to 4K directly to computers, TVs and mobile devices. These new hardware partners include ARM, Broadcom, Intel, LG, Marvell, MediaTek, Nvidia, Panasonic, Philips, Qualcomm, RealTek, Samsung, Sigma, Sharp, Sony and Toshiba. As Francisco Varela, Google?s global director for platform partnerships told me, we should see native support for VP9 in TVs and Blu-ray players in many of the 2015 models of these manufacturers, and computers and mobile devices will also start supporting it over the course of 2014. For most laptops and high-end mobile devices, hardware support is optional, as they can use a software decoder. For the best results, though ? and the longest battery life ? hardware support is necessary. Virtually all of these manufacturers already offer this support for H.264. Google argues that encoding videos with VP9 results in about 50% bandwidth savings compared to its older a0VP8 codec or the H.264 standard.  As Varela told me, support for VP9 on YouTube means that videos will start faster (there?s less data to move, after all), though it will take a while before the site has converted all videos to VP9. While the new codec will make streaming at any resolution faster, HD ? and especially 4K video ? will see the biggest benefits. For 4K, Varela argues, more efficient codecs are ?absolutely necessary.?
