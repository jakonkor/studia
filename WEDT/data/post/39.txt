The console wars are in full swing, and no contender is more focused on the pure gaming experience as the PS4 . Sony?s next-gen PlayStation is not like the Xbox One, which is leaning more toward the media console space than ever before. Instead, the PS4 is built squarely for the gaming enthusiast. The PS4 is essentially an x86-based personal computer, making it easy for developers to build new titles and port over PC games, and it comes with a DualShock 4 controller. It?s a beauty, with a Vita-style touchpad and Kinect-like capabilities thanks to a 3D ?stereo? camera accessory. However, is it worth rushing out and getting one right this second? Probably not. The PS4 is a beautiful machine that not only enhances graphics but elevates the entire experience. However, game variety is a bit of an issue early on. Plus, the console probably has a pretty long lifespan (at least five years), with price drops along the way.
