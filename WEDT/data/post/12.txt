A six-year old girl named Sophia Liu was tragically killed last night when an SUV driver confirmed to be an Uber-contracted driver struck her in a San Francisco crosswalk. Uber has essentially denied liability, noting in a statement that ?this tragedy did not involve a vehicle or provider doing a trip on the Uber system?. a0Uber?s insurance does not cover drivers between rides, but the accident raises questions of whether it should. Uber?s Denial Of Liability In Girl?s Death Raises Accident Insurance Questions The San Francisco Police Department told local news channel KTVU that just before 8pm on New Year?s Eve, a mother and her two young children, Sophia and her brother, were crossing the street at Polk and Ellis in SF?s Tenderloin district. Supervisor Jane Kim said an SUV driver that Uber confirms was one of their contractors turned right into the crosswalk without yielding to the pedestrians who had the green light, and struck the entire family. a0Sophia was brought to SF General Hospital where she sadly passed away. Sophia?s brother is expected to survive but her mother was recently listed in critical condition due to life threatening injuries from the accident. Above in a screenpic from KTVU?s coverage, you can see the grey Honda Pilot vehicle in the crosswalk at Polk and Ellis.  Officer Gordon Shyy tells SFAppeal that the driver was 57-year old Union City man Syed Muzzafar. Muzzafar stayed on the scene and was cooperative with police. He was later arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter. The SF Superior Court told VentureBeat that a0Muzzafar posted $300,100 for bail yesterday, and will return to court on January 7. Uber posted a ?Statement On New Year?s Eve Accident ? on its blog, a0offering condolences to the victim and her family, but also distancing itself from any cuplability: ?Our hearts go out to the family and victims of the accident that occurred in downtown San Francisco last night.
