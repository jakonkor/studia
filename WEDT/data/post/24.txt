We basically all knew this, but science just confirmed that novice drivers are easily distracted by cellphones on the road which leads, almost inevitably , to accidents. The study, conducted by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute and the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, watched drivers as they texted, tweeted, and got into accidents. They found that as young drivers spent a few more months behind the wheel their initial skittishness turns into confidence, multi-tasking, and crashes. According to the study, ?drivers from 15 years to 20 years of age represent 6.4 percent of all motorists on the road, but account for 11.4 percent of fatalities and 14 percent of police-reported crashes resulting in injuries.? ?The true risk is probably higher than indicated,? said Feng Guo, co-author of the study. Essentially what happens is that novice drivers begin with an excess of caution and then become distracted. By watching multiple drivers with hidden video cameras they?ve seen novices slowly become as distracted as their experienced counterparts.
