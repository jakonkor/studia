It?s not uncommon to search the Google Play app store and find a number of knock-off or ?fake? apps aiming to trick unsuspecting searchers into downloading them over the real thing ? especially when the app in question isn?t yet available on Android.

Many of the apps chosen are still iOS-only, making the matter worse. Listed under the developer?s very generic name, ?Premium App ,? the knock-offs sometimes have a ?U? following the app?s title, indicating that they?re really just a user?s guide to the service, not the real app. Many, like IFTTT, (which Premium App has ripped off twice ? once as ?IFTT? instead of ?IFTTT? to capitalize on misspellings), are available as paid downloads ranging from $1.36 USD to $2.75 USD.
