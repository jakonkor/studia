Media is not owned or created but fleeting and temporary like the services we consume. We buy things literally a touch of a finger from iTunes, never hold our purchases and then share them with people we have never met. While many speculate that security is a sound reason for the shift, ultimately, apps like snapchat with their recent release are building in versions that actually reverse the tide in the ability to save off the media. The ephemeral age will be defined by what social media theorist Nathan Jurgenson calls the ?Liquid Self?. a0Identity in 2014 will be the temporary state we take in our moment by moment temporary services and post identity narrative.  These kinds of conversations are popping up on Meatspace. it attracts the alpha-geeks which points to why this concept of sharing, escape and rejection of ownership is emitting powerful signals that will force any number of questions about how we exist in the meatspace this new year and beyond.
